Ubuntu/Debian Pomodoro Notifier

This program uses libnotify to provide you with alerts for using the 
Pomodoro technique for time management.  The benefit of using this notifier 
system is that the alerts fit in nicely with the system, as they look like 
part of the OS.

I can't take credit for the original idea, as I found the original script
on a blog.  You can find the original script and that post here:

INSTRUCTIONS

To run this script, you need libnotify-bin and aplay installed on your
system. Simply running the following command will do install them:

	apt-get install libnotify-bin aplay

		*aplay may already be installed on your system.

Afterwards, to run the script itself, you run the command:

	sh pomodoro.sh

If you'd like the script to run in the background, so that you can close the
terminal window, simply add "&" to the end of the command, like so:

	sh pomodoro.sh &

You'll need to edit the script so that the image location points to where
you're storing the pomodoro.png image.  Otherwise, it will just run without
the image.

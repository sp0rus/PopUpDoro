Ubuntu/Debian Pomodoro Notifier

DESCRIPTION

This program uses libnotify to provide you with alerts for using the 
Pomodoro technique for time management.  The benefit of using this notifier 
system is that the alerts fit in nicely with the system, as they look like 
part of the OS.

The intent of this program was to create an unobtrusive notification system
for use with the Pomodoro Technique.  I was not satisfied with the solutions
I had seen, and when I found out about libnotify (through a post using it for
Pomodoro), I thought it to be what I was looking for.  A few improvements
later, I had something I actually wanted to use.

Again, I can't take credit for the original idea.  You can find the original 
script and the blog post it came from here:

INSTRUCTIONS

To run this script, you need libnotify-bin and aplay installed on your
system. Simply running the following command will do install them:

	apt-get install libnotify-bin aplay

		*aplay may already be installed on your system.

Afterwards, to run the script itself, you run the command:

	sh pomodoro.sh

If you'd like the script to run in the background, so that you can close the
terminal window, simply add "&" to the end of the command, like so:

	sh pomodoro.sh &

You'll need to edit the script so that the image location points to where
you're storing the pomodoro.png image.  Otherwise, it will just run without
the image.

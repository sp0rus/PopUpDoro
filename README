Ubuntu Pomodoro Notifier

This program uses libnotify in ubuntu to provide you with alerts for using
the Pomodoro technique for time management.  The benefit of using the built
in Ubuntu notifier system is that the alerts fit in nicely with the system,
as they are native notifications.

I can't take credit for the original idea, as I found the original script
on a blog.  You can find the original script and that post here:

INSTRUCTIONS

To run this script, you need libnotify-bin installed on your Ubuntu system.
Simply running the following command will do install it:

	apt-get install libnotify-bin

Afterwards, to run the script itself, you run the command:

	sh pomodoro.sh

If you'd like the script to run in the background, so that you can close the
terminal window, simply add "&" to the end of the command, like so:

	sh pomodoro.sh &

You'll need to edit the script so that the image location points to where
you're storing the pomodoro.png image.  Otherwise, it will just run without
the image.
